# Account_Service_hyperskill-
A Company sends out payrolls to employees using corporate mail. This solution has certain disadvantages related to security and usability. 
I suggested an idea of sending payrolls to the employee's personal account on the corporate website. 
This project is an implemention of this idea. 
Endpoints are available to employees based on their role and function.
This project was completed as part of requirement for the JetBrains Backend Developer certification.
